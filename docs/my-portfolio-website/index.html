      <h2>My Journey to SDE</h2>
      <p>It all began with a spark of curiosity, a deep desire to understand how software works and how it shapes the world around us. That curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I’m currently studying as a university student, learning both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of software development.
        I started by mastering the essentials: Python for solving problems with logic and clarity, and HTML/CSS for bringing digital ideas to life. Eager to push further, I began learning JavaScript and SQL, which allowed me to build interactive, dynamic applications and manage data efficiently.
        Each project I built, whether a simple landing page or a fully functional app shaped my skills and mindset. I encountered challenges, solved bugs, and learned how to think like a developer. More importantly, I discovered the joy of building things that are useful and meaningful.
        Today, I’m on a clear path: to become an exceptional Software Development Engineer (SDE). Not just someone who writes code, but someone who builds impactful tools—solutions that solve real-world problems, enhance lives, and empower others to create.
        This is more than just a career goal, it's a passion and a commitment to lifelong learning.
