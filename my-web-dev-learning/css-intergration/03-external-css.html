            <p>
                Hi, I'm Nyasha! This site is my own digital notebook where I collect stories, myths, and thoughts about giants—both the legendary kind and the personal challenges I face as a developer.

            <h2>My Favourite Giants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Goliath – Reminds me that even the biggest problems can be solved with the right mindset.</li>
                <li>Atlas – Inspires me to keep carrying my dreams, no matter how heavy they feel.</li>
                <li>Ymir – Represents new beginnings and the raw creative energy I try to bring to my projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Giants appear in stories from every continent. For me, they represent the challenges I face and the strength I find within myself to overcome them—especially when learning something new in tech!

                <h3 style="color: #b8860b;">My Reflection</h3>
                <p>As a kid, I pictured giants shaping the world. Now, I see every bug I fix and every new concept I learn as a mountain moved by my own hands.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #4682b4;">Something Cool</h3>
                <p>Some African legends say giants are wise guardians, not just obstacles. I like to think of my mentors and friends as the giants who help me grow.</p>
